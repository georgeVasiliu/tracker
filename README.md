master branch for the timetracker application

This is currently just a very pre-alpha thing, the master WILL not be used as it currently is.
For now, the preliminary steps for creating the app must be completed successfully before ANY attempt to work here will begin.
Registering date for narcissistic purpose : 14 April 2017, 16:15. Hopefully, this shit won't be abandoned by me as quickly as I abandon
other stuff and it will turn to a successful app. Don't be stupid, George.
